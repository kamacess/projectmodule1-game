The morning chill catches you by surprise. // Shiver + isCold // Blow on your fingers + isCold //   
The autumn is slowly turning into winter, and you wish you had a better coat to keep you warm on your way to work.
The streets are busy.
In the crowd, something catches your attention.
Every year, twice a year actually, you have to bear the same sight.
When the weather changes, people buy themselves new fancy overcoats.
And a growing proportion seem to be oblivious of the stitched slit.
No matter how cheap you are, you know that this little x stitches keeping together the two sides of the slit on overcoats has to be cut. But how raised these people? They walk briskly, unaware of the atrocious sight they make everyone endure.
The sheer thought of it infuriates you.
Thousands of years in the history of humankind, evolution, technical progress, has made refined tailors think of stitching together the slits of new raincoats and jackets so that they look good in the shop. These honorable persons believe that the end users would think of cutting these, so that the original purpose of the slit, being able to walk freely, shall be accomplished.
But eveyday in the busy streets of your city, you witness these admirable efforts being trampled.
Ignored.
Neglected.
It makes you want to kill something.
option: kill something. 
option: dismiss the thought.
option: plan on carrying a tiny pair of scissors with you in case of emergency. hasScissors = true


As the flow of your inner monologue carries you to scheming a grand plan to better humankind by adding slit-cutting classes into middle school curriculum, you find yourself in front of your favorite park.
option : avoid the park, take the shortcut
option : 


// node 3
uneventful day at the office. 
hasScissors == true => take a pair of scissors
